# Game

## Running the code

`./gradlew build && java -jar build/libs/game-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

## The game

It is a very simple command line based game. You are given options and must choose between them.
There are no major decisions and the story line is made to be linear.

You can save the game and load it back by passing the path to the save file.
